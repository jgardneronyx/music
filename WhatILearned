IVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN MUSIC THEORY. 
SO I WROTE A PROGRAM ABOUT MUSICAL SCALES AND CHORDS TO TRY AND IMPROVE MY SKILLS IN PYTHON 

< THREE THINGS I LEARNED >

1. How to write my own modules. More specfically how to use the dot operator
   to impliment my modules in the larger program. Instead of wrting all my 
   functions outside 'Main()', writing them to a seperate file helped me save 
   space and make my code more succinct. 

2. Properly Indexing dictionaries with key/value pairs that are objects as well
   Using a tuple as my KEY and a LIST as my value. Being careful to index them 
   properly in order to have access to them .
